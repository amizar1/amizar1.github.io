    <p>My name is Amber Mizar. I was born in <em>Bhutan</em>, grew up in <em>Nepal</em>, 
	and did last two years of high school and some college in <em>India</em>. 
	I came to the <em>United States</em> in March of 2011 directly to Omaha Nebraska.</p>

	<h3>Childhood:</h3>
	
	<p>The political situation of Bhutan was not stable in 1900s 
	so, my family (dad, mum, myself, one younger brother and one younger sister) 
	left the country and settled in Nepal.  I was six years old while our family left Bhutan. 
	Our family condition was not good at that time. But we the children 
	were lucky to get free education up to grade 10 in Nepal.</p>
	<br>
	
	<h3>Education:</h3>
	
	<p>In 2004, I completed by grade 10 from Nepal and went to Mumbai, 
	India for further study where my Aunt lives. I complete my high school there. 
	Then, I went to trade school for 2 years getting Diploma in 
	Mechanical Draftsman. After I compete my high school, 
	I started working in the Manpower Consultancy as a Recruiter Assistant
	to support myself and my family in Nepal and took evening classes. 
	After diploma in Mechanical Draftsman, I joint for my bachelor’s in science,
	Physics. In the end of my first year, I returned to Nepal and start process
	for migration to United States with my family.</p>
	<br>
	
	<h3>Life in the United States:</h3>
	
	<p>After two years of waiting for the process, finally on March 17, 2011 
	I came to United States with my family. It was challenging for us to adjust 
	in the American culture. There was language barrier as well. 
	After few months, I start working at Oriental Trading Company as a 
	production worker. Eventually, my dad also find job at Tyson Food Production. 
	My and his earning support our family financially such as paying rent, bills, 
	groceries and other basic needs.</p>
	
	<p>My goal was to go back to college and complete education. 
	In 2012, I went to Metropolitan Community college and start with ESL. 
	It was challenging for me to work fulltime and go to school. 
	After a hard work, I complete my, Associate degree in Computer Technology 
	Transfer – Computer Science in 2015. Then, I transfer my credit to UNO. 
	Programming was not for me, so I changed my major to 
	Management Information Systems. I like system development and
